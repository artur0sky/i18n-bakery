# Stocking the Pantry (Installation)

Before you start baking, you need to stock your pantry with the essential ingredients. Install the core package and React bindings (if using React) via your package manager.

## pnpm (Recommended)

```bash
pnpm add @i18n-bakery/core @i18n-bakery/react
```

## npm

```bash
npm install @i18n-bakery/core @i18n-bakery/react
```

## yarn

```bash
yarn add @i18n-bakery/core @i18n-bakery/react
```

## Kitchen Tools (CLI)

For the heavy lifting (extraction and compilation), install the CLI tools globally or as a dev dependency.

```bash
pnpm add -D @i18n-bakery/cli
```

Or run directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx @i18n-bakery/cli --help
```
