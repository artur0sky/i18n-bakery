and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-06 (The Auto-Baker)

### 🚀 Fresh from the Oven
- **File Auto-creation System (The Smart Oven):**
  - Introduced automatic creation and maintenance of translation files.
  - Files are created automatically when translations are missing.
  - Supports hierarchical directory structure based on parsed keys.
  - Automatic directory creation with recursive support.
  - Example: `t("orders:meal.title", { meal: "Pizza" })` → creates `./locales/en/orders/meal.json`
- **Translation Variants Management (The Recipe Book):**
  - Multiple variants of the same translation stored in a single file.
  - Variants organized by variable signatures for efficient lookup.
  - Each variant includes value, variables list, auto-generation flag, and timestamp.
  - Example: Same key can have variants for `["meal"]` and `["meal", "price"]`
- **Intelligent File Merging (The Mixing Bowl):**
  - Two merge modes: `append` (default) and `replace`.
  - Append mode prevents overwriting manual translations.
  - Replace mode allows updating existing values.
  - Deep merging of translation variants preserves existing data.
- **Pretty-Printing Support (The Presentation):**
  - Configurable JSON formatting with indentation control.
  - Default: 2-space indentation for readability.
  - Optional compact mode for production builds.
- **Multi-Format Foundation (The Recipe Cards):**
  - Architecture ready for YAML, TOML, and TOON formats.
  - JSON format fully implemented and tested.
  - Format-agnostic content structure for easy extension.

### 🔧 Ingredients (Technical Details)
- **Architecture:** Continues Clean Architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.
- **New Interfaces (Ports):**
  - `FileWriter`: Port for writing, reading, and merging translation files.
  - `FileSystemManager`: Port for file system operations (directories, paths).
  - `TranslationFileContent`: Format-agnostic content structure.
  - `TranslationEntryContent`: Entry structure with variants support.
  - `VariantContent`: Individual variant with metadata.
  - `FileWriterConfig`: Configuration for file writing operations.
- **New Adapters (Implementations):**
  - `JSONFileWriter`: Full JSON file operations with pretty-printing and merging.
  - `NodeFileSystemManager`: Node.js file system operations without external dependencies.
- **New Use Cases:**
  - `TranslationFileManager`: Orchestrates auto-creation using Phases 7, 8, and 9 components.
    - `createOrUpdateEntry()`: Creates or updates translation entries.
    - `createEntryWithPlaceholder()`: Auto-generates placeholder values.
    - `entryExists()`: Checks for entry existence.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with:
  - Phase 7: Uses `KeyParser` and `PathResolver` for key parsing and path resolution.
  - Phase 8: Uses `VariableDetector` for variable detection and signature generation.
- **Testing:** Added 12 comprehensive tests with 100% coverage.
  - Tests for entry creation, variants, merge modes, placeholders, and complex scenarios.
  - Multi-locale and hierarchical directory structure testing.
  - Mock-based testing for file operations.
- **Exports:** Updated `index.ts` and `types.ts` to export new Phase 9 components.

### 📝 Example Usage

```typescript
import { 
  TranslationFileManager,
  DefaultKeyParser,
  FileSystemPathResolver,
  DefaultVariableDetector,
  JSONFileWriter,
  NodeFileSystemManager
} from '@i18n-bakery/core';

// Create manager
const manager = new TranslationFileManager({
  keyParser: new DefaultKeyParser(),
  pathResolver: new FileSystemPathResolver({ baseDir: './locales' }),
  variableDetector: new DefaultVariableDetector(),
  fileWriter: new JSONFileWriter(new NodeFileSystemManager()),

// Auto-create translation entry
await manager.createOrUpdateEntry(
  'en',
  'orders:meal.title',
  '{{meal}} - ${{price}}',
  { meal: 'Pizza', price: 120 }
);

// Result: ./locales/en/orders/meal.json
// {
//   "title": {
//     "variants": {
//       "meal_price": {

## [0.8.0] - 2025-12-06 (The Variable Vault)

### 🚀 Fresh from the Oven
- **Variable Detection System (The Signature Maker):**
  - Introduced automatic detection of variables from translation calls.
  - Creates unique signatures for different variable combinations.
  - Alphabetically sorted signatures ensure consistent identification.
  - Example: `{ meal: "Pizza", price: 120 }` → signature `["meal", "price"]` → key `"meal_price"`
- **Translation Variants (The Recipe Variations):**
  - Support for multiple variants of the same translation key based on variable signatures.
  - Each variant stores its own value, variables list, and metadata.
  - Automatic timestamp tracking for entry creation/updates.
  - Example: Same key `"meal.title"` can have variants for `["meal"]` and `["meal", "price"]`
- **Auto-generation Templates (The Placeholder Baker):**
  - Configurable default value generation for missing translations.
  - Two template styles: `variables-only` (e.g., `"{{meal}} {{price}}"`) and `empty` (e.g., `""`)
  - Smart placeholder insertion based on detected variables.
- **In-Memory Variant Management (The Organized Pantry):**
  - Efficient storage structure for translation variants.
  - Multi-locale and multi-namespace support.
  - Fast retrieval by signature for optimal runtime performance.

### 🔧 Ingredients (Technical Details)
- **Architecture:** Continues Clean Architecture pattern with new domain interfaces and adapters.
- **New Interfaces (Ports):**
  - `VariableDetector`: Port for detecting variables and creating signatures.
  - `TranslationEntryManager`: Port for managing translation entries with variant support.
  - `VariableSignature`: Type for unique variable combinations.
  - `TranslationEntry`: Interface for translation entries with metadata.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-12-06 (The Structured Pantry)

### 🚀 Fresh from the Oven
- **Advanced Key Engine (The Filing System):**
  - Introduced hierarchical key parsing with support for directory structures.
  - Keys now support `:` (colon) for directory levels and `.` (dot) for file and property separation.
  - Intelligent parsing rules based on colon count:
    - **NO colons**: All dots are nested properties in `global` file (e.g., `user.profile.name` → `global.json`)
    - **ONE colon**: First dot-part is file, rest are nested properties (e.g., `orders:meal.user.name` → `/orders/meal.json`)
    - **MULTIPLE colons**: Dots become directories (e.g., `app:features:orders:meal.component.title` → `/app/features/orders/meal/component.json`)
- **Path Resolution (The Map):**
  - Added `FileSystemPathResolver` to translate parsed keys into actual file system paths.
  - Configurable base directory and file extension support.
  - Automatic directory structure generation based on key hierarchy.
  - Zero external dependencies - custom path joining implementation.
- **Key Normalization (The Quality Check):**
  - Automatic cleanup of malformed keys (duplicate separators, whitespace, etc.).
  - Ensures consistent key representation across the application.

### 🔧 Ingredients (Technical Details)
- **Architecture:** Implemented using Clean Architecture principles with clear separation between domain (interfaces) and adapters (implementations).
- **New Interfaces (Ports):**
  - `KeyParser`: Port for parsing translation keys into structured components.
  - `PathResolver`: Port for resolving parsed keys to file system paths.
  - `ParsedKey`: Structured representation of a parsed key.
  - `PathResolverConfig`: Configuration for path resolution.
- **New Adapters (Implementations):**
  - `DefaultKeyParser`: Default implementation of key parsing logic with intelligent colon/dot handling.
  - `FileSystemPathResolver`: File system-based path resolution without external dependencies.
- **Testing:** Added 33 comprehensive tests with 100% coverage of parsing scenarios and edge cases.
  - 21 tests for `DefaultKeyParser` covering normalization, simple keys, directories, nested properties, and i18next compatibility.
  - 12 tests for `FileSystemPathResolver` covering path resolution, configurations, and real-world scenarios.
- **Exports:** Updated `index.ts` and `types.ts` to export new interfaces and adapters.
- **Breaking Changes:** None. This is a new feature that doesn't affect existing functionality.
